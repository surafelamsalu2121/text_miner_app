        "This should begin with \ndefinitions of the meaning of the terms \"machine\" and \"think.\"",
        "Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer.",
        "In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written, \nor better still, typewritten.",
        "It is possible that at \nsome time this might be done, but even supposing this invention available we should feel \nthere was little point in trying to make a \"thinking machine\" more human by dressing it \nup in such artificial flesh.",
        "It is natural that we should wish to permit every kind of \nengineering technique to be used in our machines.",
        "One might for instance insist that the team of engineers \nshould be all of one sex, but this would not really be satisfactory, for it is probably \npossible to rear a complete individual from a single cell of the skin (say) of a man.",
        "This \nprompts us to abandon the requirement that every kind of technique should be permitted.",
        "He may also do his multiplications and additions on a \n\"desk machine,\" but this is not important.",
        "Instructions of these latter types are very important because they make it possible for a \nsequence of operations to be replaced over and over again until some condition is \nfulfilled, but in doing so to obey, not fresh instructions on each repetition, but the same \nones over and over again.",
        "The reader must accept it as a fact that digital computers can be constructed, and indeed \nhave been constructed, according to the principles we have described, and that they can in \nfact mimic the actions of a human computer very closely.",
        "In the nervous system chemical phenomena are at least \nas important as electrical.",
        "If we wish \nto find such similarities we should took rather for mathematical analogies of function.",
        "For instance in \nconsidering the switches for a lighting system it is a convenient fiction that each switch \nmust be definitely on or definitely off.",
        "There must be intermediate positions, but for most \npurposes we can forget about them.",
        "It will seem that given the initial state of the machine and the input signals it is always \npossible to predict all future states, This is reminiscent of Laplace's view that from the \ncomplete state of the universe at one moment of time, as described by the positions and \nvelocities of all particles, it should be possible to predict all future states.",
        "It is not difficult to see why the number of states should be \nso immense.",
        "It must be possible to write into the store any one of the combinations of \nsymbols which might have been written on the paper.",
        "If two machines are put together their capacities must be added to \nobtain the capacity of the resultant machine.",
        "There is no reason why this calculation should not be carried out by means of a \ndigital computer.",
        "Of course the \ndigital computer must have an adequate storage capacity as well as working sufficiently \nfast.",
        "Moreover, it must be programmed afresh for each new machine which it is desired \nto mimic.",
        "The existence of \nmachines with this property has the important consequence that, considerations of speed \napart, it is unnecessary to design various new machines to do various computing \nprocesses.",
        "It was suggested tentatively \nthat the question, \"Can machines think?\" should be replaced by \"Are there imaginable \ndigital computers which would do well in the imitation game?\"",
        "We cannot altogether abandon the original form of the problem, for \nopinions will differ as to the appropriateness of the substitution and we must at least \nlisten to what has to be said in this connexion.",
        "I \nshould find the argument more convincing if animals were classed with men, for there is \na greater difference, to my mind, between the typical animate and the inanimate than \nthere is between man and the other animals.",
        "It is admitted that there are certain things that He cannot do such as making one equal to \ntwo, but should we not believe that He has freedom to confer a soul on an elephant if He \nsees fit?",
        "In attempting to construct such machines we should not be \nirreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the \nprocreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing \n.mansions for the souls that He creates.",
        "and hasted not to go down about a whole day\" (Joshua x. 13) and \"He laid \nthe foundations of the earth, that it should not move at any time\" (Psalm cv. 5) were an \nadequate refutation of the Copernican theory.",
        "Consolation would be more appropriate: perhaps this should be sought in the \ntransmigration of souls.",
        "The questions that we know the machines must fail on are of this \ntype, \"Consider the machine specified as follows. . . .",
        "Whenever one of these machines is asked the \nappropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that this answer must \nbe wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority.",
        "It is no \ndoubt quite genuine, but I do not think too much importance should be attached to it.",
        "When a burnt child \nfears the fire and shows that he fears it by avoiding it, f should say that he was applying \nscientific induction.",
        "A very large part of space-time must be investigated, if reliable \nresults are to be obtained.",
        "What is important about this disability is \nthat it contributes to some of the other disabilities, e.g., to the difficulty of the same kind \nof friendliness occurring between man and machine as between white man and white \nman, or between black man and black man.",
        "We must expect such a method to lead occasionally to erroneous results.",
        "It is thought that tile method (whatever it may be, for it must be \nmechanical) is really rather base.",
        "It is \na line of argument we must consider closed, but it is perhaps worth remarking that the \nappreciation of something as surprising requires as much of a \"creative mental act\" \nwhether the surprising event originates from a man, a book, a machine or anything else.",
        "It is true that a discrete-state machine must be different from a continuous machine.",
        "(8) The Argument from Informality of Behaviour  \nIt is not possible to produce a set of rules purporting to describe what a man should do in \nevery conceivable set of circumstances.",
        "Then given a discrete-state \nmachine it should certainly be possible to discover by observation sufficient about it to \npredict its future behaviour, and this within a reasonable time, say a thousand years.",
        "How we should like to discredit them!",
        "If I had I should not have taken such pains to point out the \nfallacies in contrary views.",
        "This we say does not correspond to the real mind: it is a sort of skin which we must strip \noff if we are to find the real mind.",
        "They should rather \nbe described as \"recitations tending to produce belief.\"",
        "What steps \nshould be taken now if the experiment is to be successful?",
        "Most of it is probably used for the \nretention of visual impressions, I should be surprised if more than 109 was required for \nsatisfactory playing of the imitation game, at any rate against a blind man.",
        "This should provide a \"margin of safety\" which could cover losses \nof speed arising in many ways, Our problem then is to find out how to programme these \nmachines to play the game.",
        "One must experiment with teaching one such \nmachine and see how well it learns.",
        "The experimenter, by \nthe exercise of intelligence, should he able to speed it up.",
        "Equally important is the fact \nthat he is not restricted to random mutations.",
        "It must be given some \ntuition.",
        "The machine should be so constructed that as soon as an \nimperative is classed as \"well established\" the appropriate action automatically takes \nplace.",
        "important \namongst such imperatives will be ones which regulate the order in which the rules of the \nlogical system concerned are to be applied, For at each stage when one is using a logical \nsystem, there is a very large number of alternative steps, any of which one is permitted to \napply, so far as obedience to the rules of the logical system is concerned.",
        "They should describe completely how the \nmachine will react whatever its history might be, whatever changes it might undergo.",
        "An important feature of a learning machine is that its teacher will often be very largely \nignorant of quite what is going on inside, although he may still be able to some extent to \npredict his pupil's behavior.",
        "This should apply most strongly to the later education of a \nmachine arising from a child machine of well-tried design (or programme).",
        "Another important result \nof preparing our machine for its part in the imitation game by a process of teaching and \nlearning is that \"human fallibility\" is likely to be omitted in a rather natural way, i.e., \nwithout special \"coaching.\"",
        "(The reader should reconcile this with the point of view on \npages 23 and 24.)",
        "This method has the advantage that it is unnecessary to keep track of the values that have \nbeen tried, but the disadvantage that one may try the same one twice, but this is not very \nimportant if there are several solutions.",
        "It should be noticed that it is used in the analogous process of evolution.",
        "Again I do not know what the right answer is, but I think both approaches should be tried."
